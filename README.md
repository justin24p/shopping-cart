### About the project

In this project, I used React to create routes for the store, including library, cart, and dynamic game routes based on IDs using React Router. I utilized outlets to pass state between routes and employed React Context for global state management.

To fetch data, I utilized useEffect for making API calls, ensuring dynamic content updates based on user interactions. I also developed an ASCII algorithm to derive consistent game prices, maintaining uniformity across different sections despite varying API requests.
